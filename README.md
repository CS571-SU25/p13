# (IMPORTANT) Web Project: Draft Website

I've been working out of the `integration` branch. The code currently in the `main` branch is from the video tutorial. I don't want to merge just yet, so if it's possible and/or not too inconvenient, could the `integration` branch be the version that is downloaded and graded?
