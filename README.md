# Web Project: Final Website

**Note**: Everything is in the main branch. However, I had to remove a submodule because of build issues. It's meant to work with some specific hardware the submodule is for, but I just removed it after unsuccessfully deploying it (which might not be possible). Also, when I go to https://cs571-su25.github.io/p13/, I get a security warning from Chrome. I think it's because I ask the user for permission to use their machine's microphone.
